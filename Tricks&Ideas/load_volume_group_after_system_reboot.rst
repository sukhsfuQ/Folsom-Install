==============

The Cinder service uses a volume group usually named cinder-volumes to provide storage for VMs. Unfortunatly, this volume group gets lost after a system reboot which causes failure when there is a volume provisioning. 

1. How to fix it?
====================

* To automatically load the volume group after a system reboot, proceed like the following::

   sudo su
   nano /etc/rc.local

* Add the following line to the rc.local file **before the exit 0 line **::
   
   losetup /dev/loop2 %Your_path_to_cinder_volumes%

* Exit and save.::

**That's it**, try it out by rebooting your system and then run the vgdisplay command.

2. I have a better idea!
